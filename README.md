# Alteryx Formula AddOns
Set of Xml Based Formula AddOns for Alteryx
- For version 9: put into %Program Files%\Alteryx\bin\RuntimeData\FormulaAddIn (or wherever you installed Alteryx)
- For version 10: put into %LocalAppData%\Alteryx\bin\RuntimeData\FormulaAddIn

Currently have:
## StringUtils
Some basic string functions I needed (e.g. StartsWith, EndsWith). Ned has incorporated these into the v10 code base so not needed there.

## TrigFunctions
A couple of basic functions for working with trigonometry stuff

## DateUtils
Some useful date functions
